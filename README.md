# INTRODUCTION

Remember Tic Tac Toe? See [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) if you can’t remember the rules, or if you haven’t ever played. It involves a couple of players, a simple board, checking for victory in a game loop… all the conditions that make it a fun little problem to solve while showcasing my OOP skill. Let’s build it!

A tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns. I also wrote a test for the game.
